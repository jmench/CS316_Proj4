Description:
    This is a simple web application written in PHP that displays a form where
    the user can select from different values that are fed in through a JSON
    file. Upon submitting, the webpage displays information about the selected
    value from the form.

Questions:
    1.  A) HTML form -> working
        B) dynamic OPTIONS for SELECT fields -> working
        C) HTML report -> working
        D) dynamic fields for report (no hard-coded fieldnames) -> working
        E) EXTRA CREDIT 1 -> not implemented
        F) EXTRA CREDIT 2 -> not implemented
        G) EXTRA CREDIT 3 -> not implemented
    2. My program will return a JSON error from json_last_error() if there is an
        issue with the "sourcedata" URL. If the URL is valid, the program will
        use json_decode on the URL string to create an array and then
        display all the information in the first object of the JSON file at the
        top. Below, separated into paragraphs, will be the rest of the
        information from the second object in the JSON file, as requested in the
        specifications.
    3. My program error checks any JSON file that is submitted. Regardless of
        the "sourcedata" value in the GET submission, the program checks the
        relevant JSON object for the URL field, and tries to create a new JSON
        object from that URL. If it is valid, it will print out a report as
        specified. If it is invalid, json_last_error() will print a proper error
        report to the user.
